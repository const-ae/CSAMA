# Metabolomics Data Analysis Lab

The metabolomics data analysis lab focuses on the preprocessing of liquid
chromatography (LC) - mass spectrometry (MS) required to quantify feature
(metabolite) abundances in *untargeted* metabolomics experiments. Detailed
installation instructions and general information is provided below. For
questions, support etc get in touch with Philippine Louail or Laurent Gatto (see
pictures below).

## Exploring and analyzing LC-MS data with *Spectra* and *xcms*

This workshop describes exploration and preprocessing of (untargeted) LC-MS data
with the [*MsExperiment*](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MsExperiment),
the [*Spectra*](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra) and the
[*xcms*](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms) packages. The tutorial and related
data is provided as an R package and can be installed with
`BiocManager::install("jorainer/xcmsTutorials")` and in addition a docker
container is available bundling the required software, source code and data. The
source code of the workshop is available on
[github](https://github.com/jorainer/xcmsTutorials) which provides also detailed
installation instructions.
